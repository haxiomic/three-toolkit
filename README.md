This is an assortment of classes I use when developing three.js haxe projects. Feel free to use them too, however, it's not designed to be user-friendly library and code here is likely to change frequently

I use three.js r118 via dts2hx (although newer versions will likely work too)

```
npm install three@0.118.3 dts2hx
npx dts2hx three.js
```
