# Three.js Toolkit

This is an assortment of classes I use when developing three.js haxe projects. Feel free to use them too, however, it's not designed to be a user-friendly library and code here is likely to change frequently. To use it, it's best to link to a specific commit to avoid troubles building in the future

Happy to accept PRs and issues!

I use three.js r121 via dts2hx (although newer versions will likely work too)

```
npm install three@0.121.1 dts2hx
npx dts2hx three
```

Some types rely on [VectorMath](https://github.com/haxiomic/vector-math), install with `haxelib install vector-math`
